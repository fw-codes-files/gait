### instructions:
1. This task use multiple azure kinects(abbreviated AK) to estimate human posture with its own SDK.
2. AKsâ€™ estimations are as observation for Belief Propagation(abbreviated BP).
3. Using UDP-Pose's estimations to get more observation for BP.
4. Realtime(in realtime.py) and offline(in dataProcess.py [def BPapplication]) mode are available.
5. Not all defs are used, some defs was used for testing datas or something else.
6. To be replenished.
