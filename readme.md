### instructions:
1. This task use multiple azure kinects(abbreviated AK) to estimate human posture with its own SDK.
2. AKsâ€™ estimations are as observation for Belief Propagation(abbreviated BP).
3. Using UDP-Pose's estimations to get more observation for BP.
4. Realtime(in realtime.py) and offline(in dataProcess.py [def BPapplication]) mode are available.
5. Not all defs are used, some defs was used for testing datas or something else.
6. To be replenished.

### How to use
data process:</p>
1.run DataProcess.getAKintrisics() function get intrisics of AK.</p>
2.run utils.calculateRTandSave() function get RT among AK. Chessboard is needed.</p>
3.run RealtimeVariAK.esitBoneLength() function get bone length of a participant.</p>
4.run RealtimeVariAK.start() function to obtain BP estimation.</p>

### flaws must be fixed
utils.LineScoreOfMultiAK() needs torch 1.12.x which has class FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights. It's correctness needs to be verified.
